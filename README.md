# Portfolio-theme-customizer
An interactive portfolio website built with React.js that allows users to customize the theme in real-time. Includes light/dark mode, primary color selection, and animated transitions using Framer Motion. Preferences are saved in localStorage so the chosen theme persists across sessions.
